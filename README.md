# MatchFilter

Match filter technique to detect child-events in time series.

This technique is used and described in Tary et al., 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2019.02.021). Also provided are utilities to pick or convert data to use in NonLinLoc, some of the parent and child-events, and some continuous data.
